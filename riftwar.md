# RiftWar

## Actions

A game consists of phases. Each phase, the active player and inactive player switch. During a phase, the active player takes actions until a failed action causes the phase to end.

Actions are:

- Move
- Close Combat Move
- Direct Fire
- Indirect Fire
- Rally

Failed actions are:

- Physical miss (failure to wound or kill) a direct fire target
- If a moving unit is wounded or killed
- Failing to rally (action goes to least recently active player)
- Passing the phase to a chosen player

For combat-related failures, action goes to the other involved player.

### Movement

Movement is in a straight line from point to point. Moving units are turned after moving. (Turning alone is also a movement). Movement range is ?? or until a terrain boundary (you can choose which side to end up on).

Reaction fire must be pointed out by the inactive player before movement and acknowledged by the active player.

Units may move in close groups. Each unit in a group is susceptible to reaction fire with active player choice of targeting order then inactive player choice of firing order. All reaction fire happens at the same movement point, if any unit is pinned or worse all stop at that point.

### Direct Fire

Requires LOS from attacker to target. Usually, ranged firing arc is 270deg for Light units, and 90deg for Medium and Heavy units.

Coordinated fire may be performed by a close group or by any set of units all with LOS to the target and a shared leader. All dice are rolled, and a wound or kill from any attacker continues the phase. Units may only coordinate fire with other units of the same class.

### Reaction Fire

When the active unit crosses the LOS of an inactive unit, the inactive unit may attack the active unit. The inactive player chooses any point along the movement line with LOS. There is no surprise reaction fire; the inactive player must point out possible dangers.

If the reacting unit hits a pin or better, the moving unit is stopped. If the reacting unit wounds the moving unit, the phase ends. On a miss, the reacting unit is unable to fire again during the current phase.

### Damage

Damage is determined by the number of d6 rolled on attack. Usually, Light units deal 3d6 damage, and Medium and Heavy units deal 4d6 damage at their proficient range, and one less at their non-proficient range.

### Hits

A target unit is hit if the attacker rolls a 5 or 6. One hit is a pin; the unit may not move again until it is rallied. Two hits is a wound, the unit is also pinned. Three hits is a kill. Wounding a pinned unit kills it. 

Heavy units can't be pinned without wounding or killed outright. They must be wounded (two or more hits) twice before rallying.

If a unit is in cover, at least one hit must be a 6 or all are negated.

### Indirect Fire

Units capable of indirect fire may do so once per phase, and may not otherwise attack during that phase. The must have LOS with an ally with LOS to the target, or with a leader who has LOS to this ally.

### Close Combat

Close combat begins when the attacking unit or group contacts the target. The attacker and defender each choose which units to enter into CC. Any unit not entered (or trying to escape later) must survive CC reaction fire, where a pin or worse keeps them close to (but out of) the fray. 

Units may join CC by moving in. Indirect or area fire on close combats is not allowed. During CC, direct fire rules apply (using the CC unit stat).

### Rally

Roll a 4 or higher on a single d6. Modify +1 if in a close group with a leader, and an additional +1 if there are no enemies in LOS.

### Transports

Units grouped with a transport are considered transported. This limits the group size. Unless otherwise stated, the capacity of a transport is 6 small units, or 1 medium unit and 2 small units. Transported units can't be targeted. If a transport is destroyed while transporting units, each unit suffers 3d6 damage.

Note that the particulars of movement out of combat do not matter very much; unarmed or unarmored transports are of little use.

## Map

The map contains structures and terrain. 

Structures (buldings, walls, giant trees) block LOS, provide cover, or both. Some structures can be crossed (windows, low walls) with an extra movement action. Ranged units can fire around the corner of LOS-breaking structures (but still have cover from return fire).

Terrain (forests, fields, magic zones) is walkable. It provides cover between units in the terrain, blocks LOS in/out. Units inside the edge get cover from outside but have LOS.

Lanes between structures/terrain are Light-sized (human), Medium-sized (bear), or Heavy-sized (tank).

Heavy units break LOS and provide cover, and ranged heavy units can turn their aim independent of position.

## Armies

### Models

Light units should be roughly 1-2in diameter. Medium and Heavy depends. Roughly 4x-6x Light size.

### Creation

Choose up to 4 unit types to create your army. (Light/Medium/Heavy, Ranged/Close). 

There is a maximum of 3 medium or heavy units per army. For each number of M/H units below 3, gain 3 extra light unit points.

Begin with 8 light unit points (plus bonus above). Each one buys either one Light Ranged or 3 Light Close. You may spend 2 points to add an additional trait to a unit type.


### Traits

Distribute 4 total among your unit types.

- Leader: Explained above. Maximum 1 per 10 units.
- Transport: Explained above
- Armored: The unit is always in cover when fighting at its proficient range
- Alert: The unit's firing arc is increased by 90deg
- Relentless: Pins do not prevent movement. Wounding a pinned unit still kills it.
- AP: Negates armor (not cover) 
- Indirect: Capable of indirect fire
- Flying: May fly when moving. If flying, ignores terrain and structures, but suffers a wound when pinned and is killed if wounded.

If you have other trait ideas, ask a11ce.
